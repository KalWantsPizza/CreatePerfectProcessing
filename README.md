# Create: Perfect Processing!

An additional recipe mod for Create on 1.21.1; for use in a community update for Mr. Beardstone's Create: Perfect World 2 patreon server. This features recipes for generating non-renewable blocks using create, and enhancements to existing block recipes.

### Recipe Examples
* Asurine, Crimsite, Ochrum, and Veridium similar to crafting Andesite
* Renewable Netherrack, Deepslate, Tuff, Lapis, Phantom Membranes, Diamonds (it's complicated!), and Ancient Debris
* Chance to crush Limestone and Scoria for copper and zinc nuggets, respectively
* Can be used in a Skyblock to automate all the things!


#### Credits
* Mr. Beardstone for his amazing [Perfect World 2: More Perfecter](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-perfect-world-2) modpack
* The PW2 Server Council (Dragonll237, gunhippy, Doppel_R, EsmeTH) for recipe collaboration

This mod is a successor 1.21.1 to [Create Skyblock Tweaks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-skyblock-tweaks).
